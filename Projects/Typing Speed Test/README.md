# Typing Speed Test

A simple Python GUI application to test your typing speed and accuracy. The user is prompted with a random sentence to type. Once they start typing, a timer begins. When done, the app calculates:

-  Time taken  
-  Typing speed (words per minute)  
-  Accuracy (percentage of correctly typed words)

This is a great tool to practice and improve your typing skills in a fun and interactive way!
